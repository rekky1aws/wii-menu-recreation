Welcome to my adaption of the wii menu.

I made it entirely using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The code is available at https://github.com/rekky1aws/wii-menu-recreation.

Apps with a blue border are working, the ones with a yellow border are still in devlopment but are safe to launch.
PLEASE BE CAREFUL, apps with a red border may cause lag, click them with precaution.

Enjoy :)
